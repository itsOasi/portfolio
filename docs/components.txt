Components represent individual or collections of html elements as features and their functionality. They can be buttons, 
forms, entire sections of a page, a custom feature developed from scratch, etc.

A basic component is simply a comp.html file in a folder named for the component. A component can also include a script.js, 
and a vector.svg.
