Exhibits represent pages in an application. They tell WAE which components to load, where to place them, 
and how they spatially interact with eachother.

An exhibit resides in the exhibits folder, and is named after the page it represents. When the user goes 
to a page with the name of the exhibit, WAE will load the corresponding exhibit file.
